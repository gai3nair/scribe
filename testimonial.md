# Testimonial for TechWriter's Tribe

There were several times I felt saturated in my job and wanted to dive into the depths of technical writing, although my exposure was limiting. 
I knew what was trending in technical writing; however, learning it on my own through YouTube videos and other sources seemed ineffective as it was not user-friendly, cohesive, and structured. That's when I heard about Tech Writer's Tribe. 
When I went through its API Documentation and Doc-as-code training curriculum, I was inclined to learn it from them. Their fees was another motivating factor as it was super pocket friendly. Every penny was worth the session. 

The assets of Tech Writer's Tribe are its exceptional tutors. 

-  Pallavi was super knowledgeable about API documentation, and she answered all API-doc-related concerns and questions zestfully and in a friendly manner. 
Pallavi's enthusiasm is inspiring and helped us learn API documentation using fun and memorable ways. 

-  Anindita is a repository of knowledge herself. Her inspiring expertise and patience in answering the student's questions are commendable. 

Both trainers used real-life and relatable examples to help us understand the concepts better, so we remember them forever. 

The sessions were great, and I would happily recommend all aspiring and established Technical Writers to please sign up for these to stay relevant.
