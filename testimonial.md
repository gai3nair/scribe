# Testimonial for TechWriter's Tribe

I do not have any certifications in Technical Writing, and I have gathered knowledge through my experience and exposure to this profession. There were several times I felt saturated in my job and wanted to dive into the depths of technical writing, although my exposure was limiting. 
Although I knew what was trending in technical writing, learning it on my own through YouTube videos and other sources seemed ineffective as it was not user-friendly, cohesive, and structured. That's when I heard about Tech Writer's Tribe. 
When I went through its API Documentation and Doc-as-code training curriculum, I found the courses structured in an easy-to-learn fashion. The fees were another enticing factor as it was super pocket friendly. Every penny was worth the session. 

The assets of Tech Writer's Tribe are its exceptional tutors. 

-  Pallavi was super knowledgeable about API documentation and there was always an answer to our API-doc-related concerns. 
Pallavi's enthusiam is inspiring and helped us learn API documentation using fun and memorable ways. 

-  Anindita is a repository of knowledge herself. Her inspiring knowledge, and  patience in answering the student's questions are commendable. 

Both trainers used real-life and relatable examples to help us understand the concepts better, so we remember them forever. 

The sessions were great, and I recommend any aspiring and established Technical Writers to please sign up for these to stay relevant.
